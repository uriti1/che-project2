        <p class="card-text">
          Plastic is not biodegradable in the same way organic materials are. It can take hundreds to thousands of years to decompose, and even then, it breaks down into smaller pieces known as microplastics, which can persist in the environment for a long time. These microplastics can enter the food chain and harm wildlife.

      <h3 class="headings">About Plastic Waste Awareness</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Plastic awareness refers to efforts aimed at educating individuals and communities about the environmental impact of plastic usage and the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling plastic materials. Here's a breakdown of what plastic awareness entails:
        Environmental Impact: Plastic awareness campaigns highlight the detrimental effects of plastic pollution on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. They emphasize the long-lasting nature of plastic waste and its contribution to issues such as marine pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change.
        Waste Reduction: Plastic awareness initiatives promote strategies to minimize plastic consumption and waste generation. This includes advocating for the use of reusable products, such as bags, bottles, and containers, and encouraging consumers to make environmentally conscious choices when purchasing goods.
        Recycling Education: Awareness efforts also focus on educating the public about the importance of recycling and proper waste management practices. This involves raising awareness about which types of plastics can be recycled, how to prepare recyclables for collection, and the benefits of recycling for conserving resources and reducing pollution.
        Policy Advocacy: Plastic awareness campaigns often advocate for policy changes at the local, national, and international levels to address plastic pollution more effectively. This may involve supporting legislation to ban or regulate single-use plastics, implement extended producer responsibility programs, or invest in recycling infrastructure.
        Community Engagement: Plastic awareness initiatives engage communities through outreach events, educational programs, and social media campaigns. These efforts aim to empower individuals to take action in their daily lives, such as participating in beach cleanups, organizing recycling drives, or supporting plastic-free initiatives in their communities.
        Corporate Responsibility: Increasingly, plastic awareness efforts also target businesses and industries, urging them to adopt more sustainable practices, reduce plastic packaging, and invest in alternative materials and technologies.

      <h3 class="headings">About Recycling process</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Recycling plastic waste is a crucial aspect of sustainable waste management and environmental conservation efforts. Here's a detailed overview of the recycling process for plastic waste:
Collection: Plastic waste is collected from various sources, including households, businesses, industries, and recycling centers. Collection methods may vary depending on local infrastructure and recycling programs.
Sorting: Once collected, plastic waste is sorted based on its type, color, and grade. Different types of plastics have different properties and recycling processes, so sorting is essential to ensure efficiency in the recycling process. This sorting can be done manually or using automated systems such as conveyor belts and optical sorters.
Cleaning: Before recycling, plastic waste undergoes a cleaning process to remove any contaminants such as food residue, labels, or dirt. This helps improve the quality of the recycled material and ensures better performance in subsequent processing steps.
Shredding or Granulating: After cleaning, the plastic waste is shredded or granulated into small pieces, increasing its surface area and facilitating further processing. This step may involve cutting or grinding the plastic into smaller particles.
Melting and Extrusion: The shredded or granulated plastic is then melted down and formed into pellets or granules through a process called extrusion. This involves heating the plastic to its melting point and then forcing it through a die to create uniform pellets. These pellets serve as raw material for manufacturing new plastic products.
Manufacturing: The recycled plastic pellets are used as raw material in the manufacturing of various products, including containers, packaging, construction materials, textiles, and automotive parts. These products can be recycled again, further extending the lifecycle of the plastic.
